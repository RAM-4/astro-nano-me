## About

Welcome to my personal website! Here you'll find a collection of my work experiences, articles, and projects. This site serves as a showcase of what I've done, what I'm thinking about, and what I'm currently working on. It's also a place where I experiment with new technologies, tools, and CI/CD pipelines. 🚀

## Tech Stack

- **Astro** 🚀: A modern framework for building fast, content-focused websites.
- **Tailwind CSS** 🎨: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **TypeScript** 🐢: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types.
- **Vite** ⚡️: A next-generation frontend tooling that provides a fast and lean development experience.

## Deployment

This site is deployed using GitHub Pages. The CI/CD pipeline is managed through GitHub Actions, ensuring that the site is always up-to-date with the latest changes.
